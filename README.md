# Prostate Cancer Detection App:
- This is an ongoing research project within the AI Lab of KSU to process the prostate biopsy images and create a model to detect the ISUP grade of the Prostate tumor.
  
## Data:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/overview)  and other hospitals data.

## Architecture

### 1. Model creation:

- Creating a machine learning model in Kaggle noteBook.

### 2. Flusk App:

- Store the model in a backend app to have live prediction.

### 3. Front App:

- A user-friendly App to consume the backend and predict the uploaded images using React + Typescript.
